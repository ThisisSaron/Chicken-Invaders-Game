# Chicken Invaders

## Overview
This project is a **recreation of the classic Chicken Invaders arcade-style game**, implemented using **Python and Pygame**. The goal was to replicate the core gameplay mechanics and feel of the original game while building the system from scratch.

To respect copyright restrictions, **audio files and sprite images are not included** in this repository. The full game logic, mechanics, and structure are implemented in code and can be easily extended with placeholder or original assets.

---

## Game Description
The game follows a traditional arcade shooter format:
- Player controls a spaceship
- Waves of enemies descend from the top of the screen
- The player must avoid projectiles while shooting enemies
- Difficulty increases as the game progresses

The project focuses on gameplay logic, collision handling, and real-time input processing rather than asset creation.

---

## Features
- Real-time player movement and shooting
- Enemy wave generation and progression
- Collision detection between projectiles and enemies
- Score tracking and game state management
- Game loop implementation using Pygame

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python** – core game logic
- **Pygame** – rendering, input handling, and game loop

---

## Project Structure
- Central game loop controlling rendering, input, and updates
- Asset loading logic designed to allow easy replacement with original assets

---

## Copyright & Assets
- Original game assets (sprites, audio) are **not included** for copyright reasons
- The repository contains **only original Python code**
- Users may supply their own assets or placeholders to run the game

---

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Strong understanding of event-driven programming
- Real-time systems and game loop design
- Collision detection and state management
- Ability to recreate complex behavior from an existing specification

---

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.x
2. Install Pygame
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Add placeholder sprites/audio or adjust asset loading paths
4. Run the main game file
